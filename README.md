# -1.Recommendation system
# Simple Recommendation System (User Input Driven)

This repository contains a simple Python-based recommendation system that suggests items (movies) to users based on their preferences. It combines **content-based filtering** (recommending items based on user-preferred genres) and collaborative filtering (recommending items liked by similar users).

## Features

- Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies that match the genres entered by the user.
- Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies liked by the most similar user, based on a user-movie like matrix.
- User interaction via command line input for a personalized recommendation experience.
- Simple, easy-to-understand implementation suitable for educational purposes or as a starting point for more advanced recommendation engines.

## How It Works

1. The program asks the user to input their preferred movie genres.
2. It also asks the user to input a user index (0-3) for collaborative filtering recommendations.
3. The program outputs two recommendation lists:
   - Content-based recommendations based on the user's genre preferences.
   - Collaborative filtering recommendations based on the likes of a similar user.

## Sample Data

- Movies: List of 4 movies, each with associated genres.
- User-Movie Matrix: Simulated user preferences over the 4 movies.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) library for matrix operations

You can install NumPy with pip:

# Simple Recommendation System (User Input Driven)

This repository contains a simple Python-based recommendation system that suggests items (movies) to users based on their preferences. It combines **content-based filtering** (recommending items based on user-preferred genres) and **collaborative filtering** (recommending items liked by similar users).

## Features

- Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies that match the genres entered by the user.
- Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies liked by the most similar user, based on a user-movie like matrix.
- User interaction via command line input for a personalized recommendation experience.
- Simple, easy-to-understand implementation suitable for educational purposes or as a starting point for more advanced recommendation engines.

## How It Works

1. The program asks the user to input their preferred movie genres.
2. It also asks the user to input a user index (0-3) for collaborative filtering recommendations.
3. The program outputs two recommendation lists:
   - Content-based recommendations based on the user's genre preferences.
   - Collaborative filtering recommendations based on the likes of a similar user.

## Sample Data

- Movies: List of 4 movies, each with associated genres.
- User-Movie Matrix: Simulated user preferences over the 4 movies.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) library for matrix operations

You can install NumPy with pip:

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the terminal or command prompt in the project folder.
3. Run the script:
4. When prompted:
   - Enter your preferred genres, separated by commas (e.g., `action,sci-fi`).
   - Enter the user index (0 to 3) to get collaborative filtering recommendations.
5. View the recommended movies displayed on the screen.

## Example
Available genres across movies include: action, sci-fi, romance, drama, thriller, adventure
Enter your preferred genres, separated by commas (e.g., action,sci-fi): action,sci-fi

Users available for collaborative filtering recommendation:
User indices: 0, 1, 2, 3
Enter the user index to get recommendations for (0-3): 0

Content-based recommendations based on your preferred genres:

The Matrix
Die Hard
Interstellar

Collaborative filtering recommendations for User 0:

Die Hard

## Customize

- Modify the `movies` list to include your own items and genres (books, products, etc.).
- Update the `user_movie_matrix` to reflect more users and their preferences.
- Enhance the similarity metric and recommendation logic for more accuracy.

# -2.Rule-Based Chatbot

This repository contains a simple **rule-based chatbot** implemented in Python. The chatbot uses predefined rules to generate responses based on user input, making it easy to understand, extend, and customize. It's a great starting point for anyone learning about chatbots, conversational AI, or natural language processing basics.

## Features

- **Pattern Matching:** The chatbot identifies keywords or phrases in user input and replies based on a set of rules.
- **Easy Customization:** Responses and patterns are stored in a way that's easy to extend.
- **No Machine Learning Required:** All logic is rule-based; no need for training data or models.
- **Command line interface:** Conversational loop in the terminal/console.

## How It Works

1. The user enters a message.
2. The chatbot checks the message against a list of patterns and rules.
3. If a pattern matches, it returns the corresponding response.
4. If nothing matches, it uses a fallback/default message.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

_No external libraries are required!_

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Save your rule-based chatbot code as, for example, `rule_based_chatbot.py`.
3. Run the script in the terminal:


4. Type your messages. Type `quit` or `exit` to end the conversation.


## Customization

- Add more patterns and responses to the `responses` dictionary.
- Implement more advanced pattern matching (use regular expressions for flexibility).
- Integrate with a web or GUI interface for a richer experience.

## License

This project is open-source and free to use or modify.

*If you need help expanding this project with more advanced logic (like context or multi-turn dialogue), or want a requirements file, feel free to ask or create an issue!*


# -3.Tic-Tac-Toe AI

This project implements an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The AI uses [specify algorithm, e.g., Minimax, Reinforcement Learning] to make optimal moves against a human player or another AI.

## Features

- Play Tic-Tac-Toe against an intelligent AI opponent
- AI uses [Minimax algorithm/other] to always make the best possible move
- Option to play as 'X' or 'O'
- Clean and intuitive command-line/user interface
- Game state displayed after every move

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository  

2. Navigate to the project folder  

3. Run the main program  

> Note: This project requires Python 3.x installed on your machine.

## How to Play

- The game board is a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns placing their mark ('X' or 'O') in empty spaces.
- The goal is to be the first to get three of your marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
- The AI will automatically respond with its move after you play.

## Project Structure

- `tic_tac_toe.py` - Main script to run the game
- `ai.py` - Contains the AI logic and algorithms
- `game.py` - Handles game mechanics and rules
- `README.md` - Project documentation

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x

## Future Improvements

- Add a graphical user interface (GUI)
- Implement different difficulty levels
- Extend AI with machine learning technique

Feel free to explore the code and enjoy playing against the AI! If you have any suggestions or issues, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
